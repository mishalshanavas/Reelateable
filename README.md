### Project Description

Reelateable is the ultimate counter-productive app designed to supercharge your reel-watching habit. Instead of helping you cut down, it encourages you to binge more—sending you reminders to keep watching, tracking your daily streaks, and gamifying your procrastination with achievement badges. It’s the productivity killer you didn’t know you needed.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People struggle to waste time efficiently. They watch reels in bursts, but without a structured approach, their procrastination potential remains untapped.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Reelateable turns mindless scrolling into a sport. With streak tracking, binge reminders, and AI-curated reel suggestions, it keeps you glued to your phone—because nothing says “self-care” like hitting a 100-day reel streak.
