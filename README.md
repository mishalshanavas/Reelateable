Project Description
This project [two to three lines describing what it does—e.g., “auto-generates coffee orders based on your mood” or “turns everyday tasks into a playful game”].

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
A totally fictional dilemma nobody actually faces—like needing to sift through endless motivational quotes to find the most uplifting one, or searching for the perfect pizza topping combo.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Your hilariously inventive answer! Describe how your project fictionally solves that nonexistent problem in an obviously over-the-top way.
